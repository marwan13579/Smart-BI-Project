## 🧠 Project Overview

The Intelligent Data Analysis Automation System is an intelligent ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between raw data and executive decision-making. It transforms standard Excel sales data into high-level strategic insights through a professional data analyst's workflow.

🔄 The Intelligent Pipeline:
- 🔐 Secure Auth: Multi-user system with encrypted passwords (Bcrypt).

- ⚡ Fast Track: Instant KPI extraction (Total Sales, Top Products) and real-time Chart.js visualization.

- 🧠 Slow Track: Strategic AI-driven analysis (SWOT, Trends) delivered via automated n8n workflows.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Agnostic Data Ingestion**: Upload any standard Excel sales file; the system adapts to the schema.
* **Dynamic Dashboard**: Real-time visual feedback using Chart.js/Bootstrap.
* **Security Gate**: Backend MIME-type validation to prevent malicious file uploads.
* **AI Strategic Reporting**: Full business analysis (SWOT, Trends, Forecasts) generated via LLMs.
* **Direct Outreach**: Automated multi-stage email delivery via SMTP.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 🔁 Workflow Orchestration
The core logic resides in **n8n**, where incoming Webhooks trigger parallel execution streams:

#### 1. Fast Track (Latency: < 2s)
* **Validation**: Strict MIME-type checking for data integrity.
* **Aggregation**: Real-time calculation of Total Revenue, Order Volume, and Top Products.
* **Delivery**: Updates the frontend via JSON and sends a "Quick Glance" email.

#### 2. Slow Track (Executive Intelligence)
* **Contextual Analysis**: Data is batch-processed and sent to an AI Agent (GPT-4o/Claude) for qualitative insights.
* **Strategic Email Delivery**: Instead of static files, the AI crafts a professional, structured email report containing SWOT analysis and actionable business recommendations.

## 🎯 System Logic & User Journey

The system is designed to provide a seamless transition from raw data ingestion to deep strategic intelligence, following a structured **Event-Driven** approach.

### 1️⃣ Operational Workflow
1.  **Data Ingestion**: User uploads an Excel/CSV sales file via the secure dashboard.
2.  **Fast Track (Synchronous)**: The system validates the file and immediately pushes KPIs and charts to the UI.
3.  **Initial Alert**: A "Quick Glance" confirmation email is dispatched via SMTP.
4.  **Slow Track (Asynchronous)**: The AI Agent initiates a deep-dive analysis in the background.
5.  **Strategic Delivery**: A final, comprehensive AI-generated report is sent directly to the user's inbox.
